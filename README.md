This is a WIP for parsing command phrases and turning them into running Python.

The Python code uses 0D techniques (basically message sending using FIFOs) and is based on Ä— (pronounced "eh" in ASCII).

The intention is to form a pipeline of components, and to have a Container component shepherd messages down the pipeline.

Once the pipeline is working, it should be possible to write a Concurrent Container that runs the same Python components simultaneously, without changing the Leaf Components
